## Why choose a static website?

A static generated website offers unparalleled speed, security, and simplicity compared to a WordPress site.

With no database or server-side processing, static sites load faster, providing a seamless experience for your visitors. They are inherently more secure, as there are no plugins or themes to exploit, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

Additionally, static sites are easier to maintain and scale, with lower hosting costs and no need for frequent updates. Perfect for businesses prioritizing performance, reliability, and efficiency, a static website ensures your online presence is both robust and hassle-free.
