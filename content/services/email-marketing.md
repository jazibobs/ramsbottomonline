## Start building your audience

Building a mailing list and capturing user emails on your website is a powerful way to grow your business and connect with your audience.

By collecting emails, you gain direct access to your customers' inboxes, allowing you to share personalized offers, updates, and valuable content that keeps them engaged.

It’s a cost-effective strategy to nurture relationships, drive repeat visits, and boost conversions. Plus, with a mailing list, you own your audience—unlike social media platforms, where algorithms can limit your reach.
